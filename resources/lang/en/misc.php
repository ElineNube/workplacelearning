In response to questions from students, we will be working in the near future to make it possible to record your reflections in the app. For this we find it important to test the designs and the first versions of this new functionality with you as users! This will take place between mid and late June. Would you like to participate? Then click on the "Yes, I want to participate" button, we will contact you shortly! If you have any questions or would like more information about this development, you can mail to esther.vanderstappen@hu.nl.
